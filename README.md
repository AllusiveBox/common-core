# What is this?

This package contains a lot of core functionality for stuff I find myself using regularly, either for my current job, personal projects, or small scripts that I write here and there. In truth, I don't expect anyone else to look at this and go "Wow, this is super cool, I need to use this!", but if you do, that's great. 

A lot of the work in here originated from [another npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@allusivebox/bootstrap) that I had originally tried to run with, but I quickly realized that it was growing massively out of scope, and that I had so many ideas I wanted to include, that I ultimately just burnt out. This package is an attempt to isolate **core** features I find myself using regularly and including them here. Anything outside that will be in another package, or per project as needed.

# Usage

As previously stated, the intended usage of this is for commonly reused functionality, be it utility functions, types, what have you. It's free to use, and if you have any improvements, bugs, or suggestions, please feel free to open an issue.

# What's Included?

I'm trying to keep this pretty bare bones. At present, there are a few classes and stuff, but the vast majority of this package (at least presently) is the various utility functions included. I do have plans for adding more stuff, it's just a matter of do they belong in the core package, or in others, is where I'm at now in the debate process.
